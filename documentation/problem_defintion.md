# Problem Definition

In modern workspaces, efficiency and convenience are paramount, yet many workbenches remain static and manually operated. This project addresses the need for a more interactive and automated work environment. The traditional workbench requires manual adjustments for tasks such as retrieving tools from shelves or adjusting lighting, which can interrupt workflow and reduce productivity. Additionally, environmental factors like time, temperature and humidity are typically monitored through separate devices, adding clutter and inconvenience to the space.


This smart workbench is designed to streamline the userâ€™s interaction with their workspace, promoting a more organized, timely, comfortable, and efficient environment for various projects and tasks.
