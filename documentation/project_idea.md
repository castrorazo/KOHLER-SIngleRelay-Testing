The proposed solution is a "Smart Workbench" utilizing the STM32L475VGX microcontroller, along with various sensors, motor and relay shields, and external power sources. This bench aims to integrate several functionalities to enhance user interaction and workspace efficiency:

* ***Automated Storage:*** Motorized shelves that open automatically, reducing the need to manually search for and retrieve tools.
-- Will use PWM/GPIO to control external motors based on UI touch or using VL5310x distance sensor to see if a certain height has been achieved. 
* ***Automated Storage Location:*** Automated light system that locates components for you.
-- Will light up led's using GPIO to signal to the user what drawer the otem they're looking for is located in. 
* ***Adaptive Lighting:*** Automated control of the workbench light, ensuring optimal lighting based on user proximity sensing.
-- Will turn on/off the workbench using GPIO, the way this gets triggered to tuen on/off is either by pressing on UI or automatic prexomity sensing from VL5310x sensor. 
* ***Environmental Awareness:*** Real-time display of time, date, temperature, pressure, and humidity on a touchscreen GUI, keeping the user informed and able to adjust the workspace environment as needed.
-- The environemnt values will be updated from the HTS221 sensor, the time things will come from the RTC. 
* ***Energy Efficiency Mode:*** Having energy-saving modes that automatically power down certain components of the workbench when not in use for a set period. For example, lights could dim or turn off, and monitors could switch to a low-power state.
-- The onboard power management mode will be automatic from the proximity sensing feature (VL5310x), which will signal the mcu to go into low power mode if nobody is near the desk.
* ***Ruler Mode:*** User can convert the device into a wireless tape measure ruler to get approximate measurements for projects, such as measuring: wood length, screw lengths, etc.
-- The suer can go into ruler mode which will then use the VL5310x distance sensor to exclusively only measure distance and display that on the screen. It will not be used to automatically sense presence at this time. 
* ***Pomodoro Timer:*** User can activate a timer for a configurable amount of time to help them focus while doing tasks and manage their time better.
-- One of the built in Timers from the mcu will serve as the mechanism for counting down the time that the user configured. 
* ***AAA Battery Testing:*** Users can plug in a battery into a battery fixture near this device to test the voltage.
-- The user can put the mcu into this mode in order to use the ADC on board to measure the voltage of a battery they have, which will be displayed on the screen.
